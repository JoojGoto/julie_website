This is a template for creating a Drupal 7 Installation sub-profile. It needs to be used in conjunction with the base_d7_profile. This profile is designed to be cloned and modified. 

Once you've built out your platform for the first time, change all mentions of "gp" to the name of your profile, 
then push it up to a new repo and reference that in the stub (which you should create by copying and editing 
gp_stub.make).

There is an experimental bash script called renamespace.bash in this profile that can be used to automatically renamespace
all the required files.

To use it run:

$ bash renamespace.bash <find> <replace>

Which for this profile would be:

$ bash renamespace.bash "gp" "your_project_name"

You'll also need to rename CLIENTNAME_theme and all references inside it.

The profile is intended to be built using drush and profiler, see the README.txt files for those 
projects for more information.
